From this issue, this allowed the CommandAPI to have interoperability with Minecraft commands and functions which is by far the CommandAPI&#39;s most admirable feature. Additionally, Combustible helped raise awareness of the CommandAPI via the Spigot forums and Spigot issue tracker.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Draycia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Draycia</a></strong>, who suggested implementing lazy evaluation for argument suggestions. This has been extended to provide the CommandAPI&#39;s context-aware system for argument suggestions based on previously filled arguments.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/HielkeMinecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HielkeMinecraft</a></strong>, who made three outstanding contributions to the CommandAPI. They created the suggestion of setting the result and success values of commands which improves the interoperability between commands registered with the CommandAPI and vanilla Minecraft commands. They also influenced the implementation of the requirements system to have more powerful command constraints and helped start the CommandAPI Discord server.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Minenash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Minenash</a></strong>, who was the driving force for the CommandAPI&#39;s 3.0 release, which added a plethora of new arguments to the CommandAPI. Minenash&#39;s research, code prototypes, documentation examples, bug testing and code review was a tremendous help to make the 3.0 release such a feature-rich version.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Michael-Ziluck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Michael-Ziluck</a></strong>, who created an amazing pull request that helped greatly improve the performance of the CommandAPI as well as structure the entire CommandAPI project into a multi-module Maven project which significantly improved the maintainability of the CommandAPI for the future.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/portlek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">portlek</a></strong>, who helped migrate the CommandAPI&#39;s repository to <a href="https://jitpack.io/#dev.jorel/CommandAPI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">jitpack.io</a>. They helped debug some technical errors with remote building and tested that the repository was working throughout the process.</li><li><strong><a href="https://github.com/469512345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">469512345</a></strong>, who redesigned and implemented the suggestions feature for arguments, bringing powerful asynchronous arguments and highly-extensible suggestions to the CommandAPI. They also implemented the CommandTree feature to bring yet another way for developers to create commands with the CommandAPI.</li></ul><p>I&#39;d also like to give a special mention to the following people that have helped find bugs or have supported the project in some way early in the CommandAPI&#39;s development: aianlinb, Baka-Mitai, Checkium, Comeza, DerpNerb, DogeBogey, endrdragon, EnragedRabisu, i509VCB, KieranGateley, lifespan, Loapu, Marvmallow, MatrixTunnel, Ricky12Awesome, SHsuperCM, SpaceCheetah, The_Gavster, Tinkot, vladfrangu, zedwick.</p>',4)),n(a,{anchor:"acknowledgements-command-api-discord-server"},{default:r(()=>e[4]||(e[4]=[t("h3",{id:"acknowledgements-command-api-discord-server",tabindex:"-1"},[o("Acknowledgements (CommandAPI Discord server) "),t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#acknowledgements-command-api-discord-server","aria-label":'Permalink to "Acknowledgements (CommandAPI Discord server)"'},"​")],-1)])),_:1}),e[19]||(e[19]=i('<p>I&#39;m well aware there are lots of users that have made significant contributions to the CommandAPI that aren&#39;t listed above!
