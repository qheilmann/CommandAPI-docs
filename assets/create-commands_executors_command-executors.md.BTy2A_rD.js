With a lot of simplifications, there are two main types of command executors:</p><ul><li>Ones that just run the command (let&#39;s call it a <em>normal command executor</em>)</li><li>Ones that return an integer as a result (let&#39;s call it a <em>resulting command executor</em>)</li></ul><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"><strong>Developer&#39;s Note:</strong></p><p>In general, you needn’t focus too much on what type of command executor to implement. If you know for certain that you&#39;re going to be using your command with command blocks, and specifically want to state whether a command returns a value, just ensure you return an integer at the end of your declared command executor. Java will infer the type <em>(whether it&#39;s a normal command executor or a resulting command executor)</em> automatically, so feel free to return an integer or not.</p></div><p>In addition to these two types of command executors, there are ways to restrict the execution of commands to certain <code>CommandSender</code> subclasses.
