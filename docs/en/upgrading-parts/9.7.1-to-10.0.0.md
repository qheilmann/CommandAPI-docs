### CommandAPI restructure

#### General module changes

For 10.0.0, the `commandapi-bukkit-xxx` modules have mostly been removed in favour of new platform specific modules that have been made for Paper or Spigot respectively:

- `commandapi-paper-xxx`
- `commandapi-spigot-xxx`

In order to update please replace your `commandapi-bukkit-xxx` dependency with either `commandapi-paper-xxx` or `commandapi-spigot-xxx`.

:::danger **Developer's Note:**

The fact that Paper is a fork of Spigot does not mean that the Spigot modules work on Paper. Paper has, especially in newer versions, made changes to internal systems the CommandAPI
uses. There are no guarantees that the Spigot modules will work on Paper in any kind or form.

Similarly, if you try to use the Paper modules on Spigot you will face registration issues and potential `NoClassDefFoundError`s, depending on the server version you use.
There again is no guarantee for any kind of compatibility.

:::

Additionally, the Kotlin module artifact names have changed. Instead of following the pattern `commandapi-bukkit-xxx`, they have now been updated as follows:

- `commandapi-core-kotlin`: was changed to `commandapi-kotlin-core`
- `commandapi-bukkit-kotlin`: was changed to `commandapi-kotlin-bukkit`

#### Code changes

The `CommandAPIBukkitConfig` class has been converted into an abstract class and is no longer used to construct a config instance. Instead, use the new `CommandAPIPaperConfig` or
`CommandAPISpigot` classes, depending on the module you use.

Further changes have been made to arguments that work with components. The classes `AdventureChatArgument`, `AdventureChatComponentArgument` and `AdventureChatColorArgument` have been
removed. Instead, the `ChatArgument`, `ChatComponentArgument` and `ChatColorArgument` have been implemented platform specific and return different types on Paper and Spigot.
On Paper, Adventure components are used while Spigot uses BungeeCord components.
