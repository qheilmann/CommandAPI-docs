# Configuration for server admins

The CommandAPI has a few configuration options to change how it functions. These options can be set in the `plugins/CommandAPI/config.yml` file, which is generated automatically when the CommandAPI runs for the first time.

## Default `config.yml` file

The default `config.yml` is shown below:

::: details **config.yml**

:::tabs
===Paper
```yaml
# Verbose outputs (default: false)
# If "true", outputs command registration and unregistration logs in the console
verbose-outputs: false

# Silent logs (default: false)
# If "true", turns off all logging from the CommandAPI, except for errors.
silent-logs: false

# Messages
# Controls messages that the CommandAPI displays to players
messages:

    # Missing executor implementation (default: "This command has no implementations for %s")
    # The message to display to senders when a command has no executor. Available

## Configuration settings

### `verbose-outputs`

If `true`, outputs command registration and unregistration logs in the console. This is primarily used for developers to identify issues with command registration.

**Default value**

```yaml
verbose-outputs: false
```

**Example value**

```yaml
verbose-outputs: true
```

### `silent-logs`

If `true`, turns off all logging from the CommandAPI, except for errors.

**Default value**

```yaml
silent-logs: false
```

**Example value**

```yaml
silent-logs: true
```

### `messages`

Controls messages that the CommandAPI displays to players. Available messages:

- `missing-executor-implementation` - the message to display to senders when a command has no executor. This message supports format parameters:
  - `%s` - the executor class (lowercase). For example `craftplayer`
  - `%S` - the executor class (normal case). For example `CraftPlayer`

**Default value**

```yaml
messages:
  missing-executor-implementation: "This command has no implementations for %s"
```

### `create-dispatcher-json`

Controls whether the CommandAPI should generate a `command_registration.json` file showing the mapping of registered commands.

This is primarily designed to be used by developers. Setting this to `false` will slightly improve command registration performance.

The `command_registration.json` JSON representation of commands is in the same format as Minecraft's [_Data Generators_ Commands report](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg_merge/Data_Generators#Commands_report). The format is Brigadier's command graph - more information about the JSON format can be found [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg_merge/Command_Data).

**Default value**

```yaml
create-dispatcher-json: false
```

**Example value**

```yaml
create-dispatcher-json: true
```

### `use-latest-nms-version`

Controls whether the CommandAPI should use the latest NMS implementation for command registration and execution.

This setting can be used to run the CommandAPI on Minecraft versions higher than it can support. For example, if the CommandAPI supports Minecraft 1.18 and Minecraft 1.18.1 comes out, you can use this to enable support for 1.18.1 before an official CommandAPI release comes out that supports 1.18.1.

:::danger

This feature is very experimental and should only be used if you know what youâ€™re doing. In almost every case, it is better to wait for an official CommandAPI release that supports the latest version of Minecraft. Using `use-latest-nms-version` is _not_ guaranteed to work and can cause unexpected side effects!

:::

**Default value**

```yaml
use-latest-nms-version: false
```

**Example value**

```yaml
use-latest-nms-version: true
```

### `be-lenient-for-minor-versions`

Controls whether the CommandAPI should be more lenient when updating to a new Minecraft version.

Similar to the [`use-latest-nms-version`](#use-latest-nms-version) setting, this can allow the CommandAPI to run on a version higher than it officially supports. As an example, this setting can allow updating to 1.21.2 from 1.21.1 but doesn't allow updating to 1.22 from 1.21.2.

:::danger

Take the warning from the [`use-latest-nms-version`](#use-latest-nms-version) and apply it here too. This is _not_ guaranteed to work either and also may cause unexpected side effects.

:::

**Default value**

```yaml
be-lenient-for-minor-versions: false
```

**Example value**

```yaml
be-lenient-for-minor-versions: true
```

### `hook-paper-reload`

Controls whether the CommandAPI hooks into the Paper-exclusive `ServerResourcesReloadedEvent` when available.

When the CommandAPI detects it is running on a Paper-based server, its default behavior will be to hook into the `ServerResourcesReloadedEvent`, which triggers when `/minecraft:reload` is run. During this event, the CommandAPI runs a custom datapack reloading sequence that helps commands registered with the CommandAPI work within datapacks. See [Reloading datapacks](../internal/internal#reloading-datapacks) for more information on this process.

By default, this value is set to `true` and the CommandAPI will hook into the `ServerResourcesReloadedEvent`. If you want, you can set this to `false`, and the CommandAPI will not hook into this event.

**Default value**

```yaml
hook-paper-reload: true
```

**Example value**

```yaml
hook-paper-reload: false
```

### `skip-initial-datapack-reload`

Controls whether the CommandAPI should perform its initial datapack reload when the server has finished loading.

The CommandAPI automatically reloads all datapacks in a similar fashion to `/minecraft:reload` in order to propagate CommandAPI commands into datapack functions and tags. This operation may cause a slight delay to server startup and is not necessary if you arenâ€™t using datapacks or functions that use CommandAPI commands. This operation can be skipped by setting this value to `true`.

Note that datapacks will still be reloaded if performed manually when `hook-paper-reload` is set to `true` and you run `/minecraft:reload`.

**Default value**

```yaml
skip-initial-datapack-reload: false
```

**Example value**

```yaml
skip-initial-datapack-reload: true
```

### `plugins-to-convert`

Controls the list of plugins to process for command conversion. See [Command conversion](command-conversion/conversion) for more information.

**Default value**

```yaml
plugins-to-convert: []
```

**Example value**

```yaml
plugins-to-convert:
  - Essentials: ~
```

```yaml
plugins-to-convert:
  - Essentials:
    - speed
    - hat
  - MyPlugin:
    - mycommand
  - MyOtherPlugin: ~
```

```yaml
plugins-to-convert:
  - Essentials:
    - speed <speed>[0..10]
    - speed <target>[minecraft:game_profile]
    - speed (walk|fly) <speed>[0..10]
    - speed (walk|fly) <speed>[0..10] <target>[minecraft:game_profile]
```

### `skip-sender-proxy`

Determines whether the proxy sender should be skipped when converting a command. See [Skipping proxy senders](command-conversion/skip-proxy-senders.md) for more information.

**Default value**

```yaml
skip-sender-proxy: []
```

**Example value**

```yaml
skip-sender-proxy:
  - SkinsRestorer
  - MyPlugin
```

### `other-commands-to-convert`

A list of other commands to convert. This should be used for commands which arenâ€™t declared in a `plugin.yml` file. See [Arbitrary command conversion](command-conversion/single-command#arbitrary-command-conversion) for more information.

**Default value**

```yaml
other-commands-to-convert: []
```

**Example value**

```yaml
other-commands-to-convert:
  - /set
  - mycommand
```
